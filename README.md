## Project Overview

This project was developed as part of the Rise Vest Frontend Interview Test, with a strong focus on creating a fully responsive web application. It demonstrates proficiency in responsive design techniques and a littlebit of animation, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices and screen sizes. The application is built using modern frontend technologies(React.js, Typescript, Tailwind.), adhering to best practices in both design and code structure.


### Key features include:

1. **Mobile-First Approach:** Optimized for smaller screens with progressive enhancements for larger devices.
Clean and Modular Code: Follows a well-organized component-based architecture for scalability and maintainability.

2. **Responsive Layout:** To adapt the layout dynamically based on screen resolution.

3. **Performance Optimization:** Implements best practices for loading speed and performance, such as lazy loading and efficient image handling.

This project showcases a solid understanding of frontend development concepts, particularly in building modern, responsive user interfaces.



## Branching Strategy

The project uses a structured branching model to ensure smooth development and deployment:

1. **main**: This is the main branch containing the stable code that is ready for production.  commits were first made here, and along the line I eventually create a development branch and then merge then merge the development into main.
  
2. **development**: This is the integration branch where features and bug fixes are merged after they have been tested. Once code was stable here, it was merged into `main`.
  
3. **production**: The branch that was used for the live production environment. It reflects the code that was currently deployed. Merges to this branch typically happen from `main`.
  
- **feature/branch-name**: All new features and bug fixes were developed in separate feature branches. Feature branches was named clearly, e.g., `feature/landing-layout`, `feature/landing-design` and for bug fixes will be this naming convention for future `bugfix/fix-nav-issue`. Once a feature was complete, it was merged into `development`.
